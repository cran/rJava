 NEWS/ChangeLog for rJava
--------------------------

0.3-8	2006-06-17
     o	.jinit has an additional parameter 'parameters' that allows
	users to pass additional parameters to the VM (such as -X...)

     o	.jinit now uses a hack (defined in .jmergeClassPath) that
	allows us to modify the class path of a running VM. This may
	or may not work for a specific VM, because it is an ugly hack
	exploiting some implementational features of the VM.
	See .jmergeClassPath source for reference and explanation.

     o	.jarray now supports the use of .jarray(x) where x is a Java
	reference. The documentation requires you to use
	.jarray(list(x)), but since the use of .jarray(x) seems to be
	a very common mistake, we may as well silently support it.

     o	.jarray has an optional parameter contents.class which allows
	the global specification of the class type for arrays of
	objects. (Untested, use with care! In most cases .jcast is
	probably what you really want.)

     o	Added some more support for floats, longs and byte arrays.
	(Again, untested)

0.3-7	2006-01-31 (non-public release)
     o	New, experimental feature has been added - JNI cache. This
	feature can be enabled by passing --enable-jni-cache argument
	to configure. Normally, each time we access JVM we retrieve
	new JNI environment to make sure there are no threading
	issues. In single-threaded environment this is superfluous, so
	we may as well cache it. The idea is reduce the
	overhead. However, the gain is not as huge as expected, so it
	is not enabled by default. Also note that threads and
	jni-cache are mutually exclusive.

     o	Another even more experimental feature has been added -
	support for threads. This feature is enabled by using
	--enable-threads configure argument. When threads support is
	enabled, JVM is started on a thread separate from the main
	thread. Some implementations of AWT classes require
	this. However, it is not always safe to use, because R event
	loop is unaware of the separate thread and can deadlock it.
