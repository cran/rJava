 NEWS/ChangeLog for JRI
--------------------------

0.5-0	2009-08-22
    o	API 1.9: added rniPreserve, rniRelease, rniParentEnv, rniFindVar,
	         rniListEnv, rniSpecialObject, rniPrintValue,
		 rniGetRawArray, rniPutRawArray, rniGetAttrNames methods
		 added jriLoaded field (boolean)

    o	new REngine-based API (org.rosuda.REngine.JRI.JRIEngine)
	has been created - this allows the same code to interface
	JRI or Rserve without re-compilation

	Note: the JAR files are currently shipped separately from the JRI
	installation and can be obtained from
	http://rforge.net/JRI/files/

    o	proxy references are now preserved until finalized

    o	if jri.ignore.ule=yes property is set, JRI will not abort on
	failing to load the JRI library (UnsatisfiedLinkException).
	This can be used by GUIs to display a more meaningful message
	instead of abort. The jriLoaded flag is false in that case.

0.4-2
    o	declare string encoding as UTF-8 and convert incoming strings
	to UTF-8 if possible (R >= 2.7.0 required).

    o	allow JRI to hook into a running R process (and thusly provide
	rJava with callbacks)
